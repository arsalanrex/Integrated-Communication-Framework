# **Integrated Communication Framework: Kafka, Apache James, Spring Boot, and Multi-tenancy**

## **Project Overview**

This project demonstrates a unified communication framework that integrates real-time messaging (chat) using **Apache Kafka** and email services using **Apache James** within a single architecture. The application is designed with **multi-tenancy** support and is containerized using **Docker** to facilitate isolated environments for multiple tenants. 

By using **Spring Boot** as the backend architecture, the system efficiently manages both chat and email functionalities, simplifying the development process, reducing redundancy, and enhancing maintainability.

## **Features**

- **Real-time Chat**: Handled using Apache Kafka, a distributed streaming platform.
- **Email Services**: Managed using Apache James, an open-source email server.
- **Multi-tenancy**: Isolates data and services for multiple tenants within the same system.
- **Containerization**: Utilizes Docker to streamline deployment and scaling.
- **Unified Communication**: A shared architecture handles both email and chat functionalities.

## **System Architecture**

The architecture is built around the following components:

1. **Apache Kafka**: Handles real-time messaging between tenants.
2. **Apache James**: Provides email services for multiple tenants.
3. **Spring Boot**: Serves as the backend API, integrating both chat and email services.
4. **Zookeeper**: Manages the configuration of Kafka.
5. **Docker**: Containerizes all components, making it easier to scale and manage multi-tenancy.
